# Enrollment Recovery System

A modular CRM solution that recovered $500K+ in lost revenue by addressing a 40% application abandonment rate at a charter school network.

## The Challenge
- 40% of families started applications but never completed them
- $500K+ in potential tuition revenue lost annually  
- Existing CRM tools too generic for charter school workflows
- Staff spending 20+ hours/week on manual follow-ups

## The Solution
Built a custom, modular system using Google Workspace tools that staff already knew:

### 🔧 [RevOps Automation Toolkit](link)
Operational backbone handling:
- Board governance document publishing
- Administrative workflow automation

### 💌 [RevOps Automation Toolkit] [Nesterly](link)
Personalized email nurture engine:
- Automated campaigns from staff Gmail accounts
- Template library for welcome/reminder sequences
- Smart scheduling and engagement tracking
- Makes every email feel personal, not automated

### 📊 Enrollment Dashboard (Private)
Real-time tracking of:
- Application pipeline status
- Drop-off point analysis  
- Family engagement metrics
- Automated follow-up triggers

## Results
- **$500K+ revenue recovered** in Year 1
- **Application abandonment reduced** from 40% to 15%
- **20+ hours/week saved** in manual follow-ups
- **3x increase** in email response rates
- **50+ staff trained** on system usage

## Tech Stack
- Google Apps Script (backend automation)
- Google Sheets API (data layer)
- Gmail API (personalized outreach)
- TypeScript (Nesterly frontend)
- Google Workspace (infrastructure)

## Architecture

## Why This Approach?
- **Low barrier to entry**: Built on tools staff already used (Google Workspace)
- **Modular design**: Each component can be used independently or together
- **Personal touch**: Automation that doesn't feel automated
- **Scalable**: Started with one school, now used across the network
